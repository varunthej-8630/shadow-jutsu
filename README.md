A real-time **Shadow Clone Jutsu** experience powered by your webcam and machine learning. Train your own hand sign, perform it in front of the camera, and watch your clones appear with smoke effects — just like Naruto! 

Built with **MediaPipe**, **TensorFlow.js**, and **pure JavaScript**. No Python. No frameworks. Just pure ninja energy. 🔥

## 🎥 Demo

> Do your hand sign → Confidence hits 100% → **BOOM. Clones everywhere.**

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **Custom ML model** — trained by YOU, on YOUR hand sign
- 👁️ **Real-time hand tracking** — powered by MediaPipe Holistic
- 🧍 **Selfie Segmentation** — isolates your body from background (so clones look clean)
- 💨 **Animated smoke effects** — frame-by-frame sprite animation
- 🔶 **Orange finger skeleton** — because green was too basic
- 🔄 **Reset Jutsu button** — trigger clones again without refreshing like a caveman
- 🎨 **Naruto-themed UI** — Konoha vibes, orange accents, cool fonts
- 💧 **Chakra level indicator** — that's just the confidence % but it sounds way cooler
- 🖊️ **Varunthej watermark** — yes, your name is literally burned into every frame

## 🧠 How It Works

```
Webcam → MediaPipe Holistic → Hand Landmarks → Normalize → Neural Network → Clone Trigger
                ↓
        Selfie Segmentation → Person Mask → Clone Rendering
```

1. **MediaPipe Holistic** tracks 21 landmarks per hand through your webcam every single frame
2. **Selfie Segmentation** isolates your body from the background so clones look clean
3. Your **custom TensorFlow.js model** (trained by you in the trainer) takes both hand landmark positions and predicts: *"Is this the clone sign or not?"*
4. When confidence crosses **99.9%** — shadow clones spawn with smoke effects 💥
5. Your main self always renders on top — you are the original Naruto after all

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (for running a local server)
- Google Chrome (recommended — Safari might throw a tantrum)
- A webcam
- Naruto energy ⚡

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/varunthej-8630/shadow-jutsu.git
cd shadow-jutsu
```

### 2. Start the local server

```bash
npx serve -p 3000
```

> ⚠️ Don't use ports like 143 — Chrome will block them with `ERR_UNSAFE_PORT`. Just use 3000. Trust me on this one.

### 3. Train your gesture model

Go to:
```
http://localhost:3000/trainer
```

- Press **`1`** → Do your clone hand sign → Hold for 4 seconds → Repeat 10-15 times
- Press **`2`** → Do random hand poses → Repeat 10-15 times  
- Click **Train Model** → Watch accuracy climb like Naruto climbing the waterfall
- Click **Save Model** → Two files download: `gesture-model.json` + `gesture-model.weights.bin`
- **Move both files** into the project root folder

### 4. Activate the Jutsu

Go to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

Do your hand sign. Watch the **Chakra Level** rise. When it hits near 100%... 

**SHADOW CLONE JUTSU!** 🔥🔥🔥

## ⚙️ Customization

### Change the confidence threshold

In `script.js`, find:
```javascript
function predictGesture(right, left, threshold = 0.999)
```
Lower it if clones aren't triggering. Raise it if they trigger too easily.

### Change clone positions & sizes

In `script.js`, find the `customClones` array:
```javascript
const customClones = [
  { x: -100, y: 100, scale: 0.9, delay: 1000, smokeSpawned: false },
  // ...
];
```
- `x` — horizontal offset from center (negative = left, positive = right)
- `y` — vertical offset
- `scale` — size of the clone (1.0 = full size, 0.4 = tiny background clone)
- `delay` — milliseconds before this clone appears (stagger the spawning!)

### Change colors

In `styles.css` and `trainer.css`, `#ff8c00` is the main orange color. Change it to anything you like.

## 🤖 The ML Model

The neural network is dead simple — and that's the point:

```
Input: 126 features (21 landmarks × 2 hands × 3 coordinates: x, y, z)
       ↓
Dense(64, relu)
       ↓
Dropout(0.3)    ← prevents overfitting
       ↓
Dense(32, relu)
       ↓
Dense(1, sigmoid)  ← outputs probability: "is this the clone sign?"
```

Trained with:
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Loss:** Binary Cross Entropy
- **Epochs:** 50
- **Batch size:** 16

> *Want better accuracy? Collect more samples. Especially edge cases — hands at weird angles, bad lighting, etc. The model is only as good as the data you feed it.*

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology | What it does |
|---|---|
| MediaPipe Holistic | Real-time hand landmark detection (21 points per hand) |
| MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation | Separates you from the background |
| TensorFlow.js | Runs the neural network in the browser |
| HTML5 Canvas | Renders clones, smoke, and skeleton overlays |
| Vanilla JavaScript | Glues everything together. No React. No frameworks. Just vibes. |
| Google Fonts (Cinzel + Rajdhani) | Makes it look like a ninja built this |

---

## 🐛 Common Issues

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Clones not triggering | Lower threshold in `script.js` from `0.999` to `0.99` |
| `gesture-model.json` 404 error | Model files not in project root — move them there! |
| Background not showing | Make sure image files (`main-bg.webp`, `trainer-bg.jpg`) are in project root, not assets folder |
| `ERR_UNSAFE_PORT` in Chrome | Don't use ports like 143. Use 3000, 3001, 8080, etc. |
| Camera not working | Make sure you're on Chrome and allowed camera access |
| Low confidence even with correct sign | Retrain with more samples (aim for 100+ per class) |
| Clones appeared but I want to do it again | Hit the **🔄 Reset Jutsu** button! |

## 📝 Notes

- Yes, this is an ML project in JavaScript and not Python. Deal with it 😎
- The model topology can definitely be improved — this is the starting point, not the ceiling
- If you want better performance: more data > bigger model (usually)
- This was built for fun, not for production. But it works. And it slaps.

## 🙏 Credits & Inspiration

- Original concept inspired by the Naruto Shadow Clone Jutsu project
- Varunthej's personal touch: orange theme, Naruto backgrounds, reset button, custom branding
- Naruto Uzumaki — for never giving up, even when everyone doubted him 🍥
